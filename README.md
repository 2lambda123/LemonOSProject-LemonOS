## System requirements
- 256 MB RAM (512 is more optimal)
- x86_64 Processor supporting [x86_64-v2 instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels) including SSE4.2
    - For QEMU/KVM use `-cpu host` or at least `-cpu Nehalem` see [this page](https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/system/target-i386.html)
- 2 or more CPU cores recommended
- I/O APIC
- ATA, NVMe or AHCI disk (AHCI *strongly* recommended)

For QEMU run with: \
```qemu-system-x86_64 Lemon.img --enable-kvm -cpu host -M q35 -smp 2 -m 1G -netdev user,id=net0 -device e1000,netdev=net0 -device ac97``` \
**KVM is strongly recommended**
