# Using LemonWM

LemonWM is the window manager for Lemon OS.

## Shortcuts
- Alt + F4 to close a window

## Configuration

```useBackgroundImage``` *(boolean)* &emsp; Whether or not to display background image.\
```backgroundImage``` *(string)*  &emsp; Path to background image\
```theme``` *(string)*  &emsp; (Currently unused) System theme\
```displayFramerate``` *(boolean)*  &emsp; Whether or not to display framerate counter.\
